### Description

Machine learning can increase the value of renewable energy 

Using historical data that is available between the years 1969-2019 for renewable production and consumption values: Can we make accurate predictions about how the values will change for each state?

### Questions

* How renewable energy production will change in the US by state?
 
* Predict a state's ability to meet its Energy Consumption needs with Renewable Energy Production

### Analysis

* Clean and modify the data using Pandas and Jupyter Notebook

* Use Heroku and PostgreSQL as the database

* Use Python as the server side language, Flask as the web server and SQLAlchemy as the ORM

* Use HTML, CSS and JavaScript on the front end

* Use Linear Regression model for machine learning

* Use D3, Plotly and Leaflet to visualise the data.
